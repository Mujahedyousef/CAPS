# CAPS

The build of an application for a product called CAPS - The Code Academy Parcel Service.  Iâ€™ll build out a system that emulates a real-world supply chain. CAPS will simulate a delivery service where vendors (such as flower shops) will ship products using our delivery service and when our drivers deliver them, each vendor will be notified that their customers received what they purchased.
